One of the most crucial steps in improving business performance is to identify opportunities and evaluate sales performance in order to establish an effective strategy. This can be accomplished through descriptive analysis of sales data.
In this project, I will do a simple sales analysis of a retail store based on a historical dataset.
The dataset used in this analysis can be found on Kaggle.

The main objective of this analysis is to better understand business performance by tracking historical transactions. The tools used in this analysis in Colab Notebooks for data cleaning and EDA analysis, and Power BI for a dashboard.
The dataset contains records of transactions/ orders of a retail company specializing in transport by selling cars, trucks, planes, ships and trains.
